// with anti-aliasing at the arc edge (see `BackdropBlendItem`). This allows
// rounding the corner of arbitrary content without rendering it into an
// intermediate texture, as long as this item is rendered after (above) the
// content.
//
// The item is expected to be square, its size being the radius of the arc. The
// arc center is placed at the opposite of the `corner` of the item.
