// This item fades what is rendered beneath it into `color`, from the `edge`
// where `color` fully replaces the content, to the opposite edge where the
// content is left untouched (see `BackdropBlendItem`).
//
// When `color` is opaque, this is equivalent to a gradient rectangle from
// `color` to transparent. When it is not opaque, the content is faded into
// the color (as opposed to being blended over by it), this means that the
// result is correct if what is beneath the content is `color` itself, such as
// when the content is on top of a uniform translucent background.
