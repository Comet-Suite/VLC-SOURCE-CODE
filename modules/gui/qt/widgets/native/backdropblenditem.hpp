// Base class for items that replace what is rendered beneath them with `color`,
// weighted by a coverage computed by the fragment shader of the subclass:
//
//     dst = color * coverage + dst * (1 - coverage)
//
// This is done in all the channels, including the alpha channel. Where coverage
// is 1, the color is written as is (akin to `ViewBlockingRectangle`, it is not
// blended over what is beneath). Where coverage is 0, nothing is changed. This
// allows masking arbitrary content without rendering it into an intermediate
// texture, as long as this item is rendered after (above) the content.
//
// The color is provided to the graphics pipeline as blend constant, the fragment
// shader only outputs the coverage (multiplied by `qt_Opacity`) in all channels.
//
// Fragment shaders get the position in item coordinates (`coord`, at location 0)
// from `BackdropBlend.vert`, and must declare the following uniform block, where
// the members following `qt_Opacity` are the values returned by `uniforms()`:
//
//     layout(std140, binding = 0) uniform buf {
//         mat4 qt_Matrix;
//         float qt_Opacity;
//         float ...;
//     };
//
// This item requires a RHI based scene graph adaptation, nothing is rendered
// otherwise (see `supported`).
